Great! Answers in-line in bold.  I'd also like to have some activities planned/paid for. Do you have pricing or details on the guided tours, tours on e-bike, massages, yoga, art class, etc.. that you mentioned?  Thank you so much for your help so far!  Best,  Zach

Hi again, Happy Saturday! I think we would only need accommodations for the Friday and Saturday night not the rehearsal dinner/ welcome dinner.  We will likely have some people camping, and do a little gathering at the campsite instead. Our wedding will be on Saturday at Loma Vista. We haven’t sent our invitations yet, and really are not sure how many people would require accommodations yet. Thinking it could be around 20-30 people. If you could send me information about reserving a block for up to 30 people that would be so fantastic. Thank you!EmmaSent from my iPhoneOn Nov 2, 2024, at 1:24 PM, Events Team <events@bigsurriverinn.com> wrote:﻿We do have that weekend available!How many guests are you thinking of inviting? Assuming you would host a rehearsal dinner or welcome party at River Inn and then get married at a different venue on Saturday?

Sounds great. I’m out of the country at the moment. Are you free for a phone call Nov. 13-16? Also happy to grab coffee, whatever’s easiest.

Hello,  My name is Annette Reich and I am interested in hosting my wedding reception at Big Sur River Inn. As directed by the website, I am emailing this address to hopefully learn of rates and scheduling.  Currently, we are looking at Summer of 2025. Our party would not exceed thirty people. We are looking forward to hearing from you!   Thank you, Annette Reich & Jagger King

Hi Ashley, I'm glad you like the live cam, me too! I check it when I'm not at work lol... I would love to show you and your partner around on Nov. 23. My schedule is pretty open and I have a colleague who helps me out with tours if needed. If you would like me to hold a date until your tour, I would be happy to do so. If I get a serious inquiry, I will reach out and let you know.  Did you have a date in mind?  Warm Regards, Breann
