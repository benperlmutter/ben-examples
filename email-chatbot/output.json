Hi there,

My fiancé and I visited the Big Sur River Inn earlier in October and we are interested in hearing more about your wedding options. We were told there were many different options ranging from a full buy out to rehearsal dinners. Just curious what all of those different options would include and what price range they each are.

Thank You,
Amber Jodaitis

Hello all,

My partner Yurij and I are getting married in late spring/early summer
2026. We live in Berkeley and love Big Sur -- we can't think of a more
beautiful place to get married, and your inn looks so lovely.

I'd like to know more about your wedding packages -- prices for renting the
venue, whether the catering and/bar would be through you all or us bringing
outside vendors, and what the accommodation situation would look like (how
many rooms could our guests rent, how much per night, etc.).

Thank you!!
Alice Kassinger

Thank you, all! I loved those pictures, the place looks absolutely
beautiful.

We're planning on having about 120 guests, and we'd plan on doing a full
property buy-out (our guests could hopefully rent the rooms directly
through you, though). Would that be the $10k quoted in the list above?
(Separate from catering and bar packages of course).

I noticed you described the bar options only under the brunch menu -- do
you also offer bar packages for the reception alongside your catering menu?
If so, are they the same options for the brunch as for the reception dinner
bar? And do you all also charge a service fee?

Thank you so much! We're just getting started, so still figuring out the
right questions to ask :)
Alice


Guest said..............................NEW PART..............................
And so sorry for the quick follow-up -- I know you said 8 suites and 14
guest rooms. Can you clarify, how many total individuals would that be?


Events Team said..............................NEW PART..............................
Hi!
So sorry! You were so quick, I accidentally skipped right over this. eek!
To answer your question, capacity depends on your guests. Are they mostly
couples or families? Below is a rooming list with capacity that helps
during the planning process.

Have a great evening!

Hi there,

My name is Emma May and my partner and I are getting married at Loma Vista
in Big Sur on August 16, 2025. I’m reaching out to inquire about reserving
a block of rooms for this date and potentially the 15th as well. Is this
something that you do? Do you have availability? What steps are required?

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Hello,
I was emailing to get a pricing sheet for the 2025 season. We are looking
at either May or August, and was curious about max headcount and how the
private events are organized on the property.

Thank you!

We're doing some more research but definitely wanted to find out when you
schedule tours to check out the venue. Maybe a Saturday in early December?
Also we are looking at either 5/31/25 or 8/2/25 if either of those dates
are available..

Absolutely, happy to help.
I created a quote for you of a typical wedding we host at River Inn. The 
great thing about us is that we offer so much in-house, from catering, 
bartending, staffing, set up and clean up, etc.. Let me know if you have 
questions regarding what's included. You will also have an opportunity to 
review our Policies and Procedures, as well as any additional fees that 
will incur.
I priced out a Saturday wedding, and you will have the option of adding on 
events like a Rehearsal Dinner, Cocktail Party, or Post-Wedding Breakfast, 
on that Friday and Sunday. We have epic wedding weekends! It sounds like we 
may be able to get your entire group staying on property. Rooms are $345 
for single and $395 for double queens and $515 for riverside suites. 
Have a great day, talk soon!

Good evening,

I was wondering if you could tell me if The  Big Sur River Inn might be
available for a wedding for about 70 people on May 3 or 4th, 2025? We are
flexible on the date if needed. We would love to know more details about
pricing and what is included, and ask some follow up questions if the time
is available.

Respectfully,
Sam Warner

Events Team said..............................NEW PART..............................
Hello Sam,
Thank you for your patience. River Inn is, unfortunately, not available on
those dates, although we do have 6/5, 6/6 and or 6/7/25 if you are flexible
on dates.

I would recommend checking out our neighbors;

The Village, Big Sur
Glen Oaks, Big Sur

Good luck on your search!

Hello!My husband and I had a courthouse ceremony a little over 2 years ago and are now finally planning our wedding ceremony/celebration at the Loma Vista Gardens on 9/26/25. We visited Big Sur in 2023 and ate at your establishment multiple times. We always had a wonderful time; great food and wonderful service. We would love for our family and friends to experience the same! We are planning on having less than 50 guests at our wedding (closer to 30-40) and would love to have our rehearsal dinner at your establishment. Would you happen to have availability for a rehearsal dinner on 9/25/25? Also, do you do room blocks for weddings?Thank you and we look forward to hearing back from you!
