To whom it may concern,  My name is Michael Coleman. I am the owner operator and director of one of the most up and coming tribute  shows to emerge on the Nevada music scene.  In my pursuit of new creative endeavors, As a progressive professional with 20+ years of experience on the  Nevada/California circuit. I believe that you can bring valuable contributions to our team.  My tribute is to the Legendary sounds of  Kool & The Gang. The title of this tribute show is "A Jungle  Boogie". I was referred to you from artists who strongly feel that you would be a very successful fit within our Legends tribute show.  *Kool & the Gang* have entertained audiences worldwide for more than 30 years. With such hits as "Ladies Night", "Too Hot", "Jungle Boogie", and the mega-smash ”Celebration”,  these ten young musicians have somehow transcended language barriers and have perpetuated a timeless message of love and brotherhood, peace and joy  within all of God’s creation.  Michael has performed with the big band to rave reviews. With an array of multi-talented musicians  and vocalist, "A Jungle Boogie" would make for an even more of a special evening.    For general information and bookings please contact us at the contact info listed at the  top of this letter. Or you can go to our website http://musicole89.org.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Happy to hear you are coming to Big Sur! Thank you for your email. I did see DeeDee's reservation in the book for 14. Would you like to increase that to 30? I will confirm with the restaurant manager that they have the space and get right back to you. Most likely fine. The best I can do would be two long tables next to each other and two seperate checks. You may use multiple cards per check but it has to be for a specific amount, no splitting. Apologies if this causes any inconvenience! Yes, please bring a cake! We do have a $5/person fee for cakes. We can refrigerate it and provide cutting and plates.\xa0 I, unfortunately do not have any decor like that but that picture is a Kate Healy job. She's a local florist and may be able to drop off some arrangements. Her number is 831-601-8689 River Inn can provide linen tablecloths and napkins Hope this helps!
